## Description
Word Draw takes a user message as input and converts each character into instruction for creating a line-drawn, abstract image. This creates a fun and interactive word-to-drawing experience! Each letter has an assigned key-value pair that gives it its unique instruction. The program includes the upper and lowercase alphabet and numbers 0-9. Word Draw utilizes the Python string split() method to enable the transfer of relevant dictionary key values into their corresponding turtle functions. Booleans, conditionals, and loops allow the program to filter through all the possible stylistic outcomes. These possible outcomes include pen color, line width, character directions, and keyword images. The program has four keywords: 'cat,' 'flower,' 'star,' and 'car.' When any of these words are typed, a specific image is drawn. 'Cat' and 'car' have detailed instructions. Alternately, 'flower' and 'star' utilize for loops to repeat the same simplified instruction to create the image. Future areas of improvement could include adding more keywords and key-value pairs to include punctuation. I would also look into a more functional way of storing the keyword functions to avoid cluttering the program. This is Word Draw!
