## Description
My program will take user message input and convert those characters to a line-drawn image. This creates a fun and interactive word-to-drawing experience. 

## Features
- Feature 1
	- I will implement turtlepy. I will utilize libraries and keys to assign each letter a variable for the direction of the line. 
- Feature 2
	- I plan to implement different colors for the line drawing. The letter at the start of each word in the input message will define what color the line is for the characters in that word.  
- Feature N 
	- I will have certain words that result in a specific picture. I will use Elif/True and False statements to know when to execute the command for the specific image.

## Challenges
- I will need to research more about turtlepy, how to use it, and what features it has.
- I must research how to implement color and pixel width changes into the image designs.
- I will need to brush up on how to have the code execute a function based only on the first character of a word and keywords.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
The ideal outcome for this project is that the user will type a message and a corresponding image will be drawn. I will implement color as well as different line widths. If things go well, I want to implement that certain words will get a specific image drawn. (“cat” for example will execute a cat line drawing.”)
Minimal Viable Outcome:
The bare essential for a good working program would be that I successfully get the text input to translate into instructions for the image to be drawn. 

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Confirm my project Idea and begin researching skills and topics needed for the project
  2. Implement turtlepy and add in key libraries

- Week 2
  1. Have word-to-picture code working 
  2. Implement adding color and other features (line pixel width changes)

- Week N (Final)
  1. Implement adding specific images related to keywords
  2. Clean up code and have the program functioning successfully
